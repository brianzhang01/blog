			<p>Hi there, and thanks for stopping by! In this post, I briefly introduce my current ideas for this blog and say a bit about myself.</p>
<p>As of September, I&rsquo;ve been a first-year PhD student at Oxford&rsquo;s Statistics department. I received my bachelor&rsquo;s in Physics from Harvard in 2015, and after working for two years am excited to be back in an academic setting. Part of this transition means more freedom and a lot more self-structured learning time. Blogging seemed like a good outlet to keep track of interesting ideas I work through, and make them more polished than my natural scratch work / code.</p>
<p>Recently, the fields of statistics / machine learning / AI have received a great amount of public attention. Many sectors across science, technology, and business are looking to get in on the benefits, which creates a demand for educational and computational resources. It&rsquo;s exciting that machine learning and data science as fields have adopted a culture of openness, which includes offering widely accessible learning materials, free software packages, and public code. As a believer in these values, blogging seemed like a great way to practice my own public communication / sharing of ideas.</p>
<p>Right now, I envision posting on the following areas, in order of high to low proportion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explanations of concepts in advanced undergraduate statistics, using visualizations and public code to help make ideas intuitive and easy to follow.</li>
<li>Snapshots of applied data analysis and visualization of some public datasets I can find.</li>
<li>General musings on the PhD experience and the cultural values of the machine learning community.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve chosen to blog primarily with the R Markdown framework, which I think is designed to easily encourage principles of reproducibility and interactivity. Stay tuned for a post on choosing a blogging framework!</p>
